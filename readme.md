# CodeCamp21-Axon Ivy Express Worflow Exporter

Express Workflows are the starting point for no-coders to implement own processes in Axon Ivy. They will define a task flow as well as UI forms for the tasks in an entirely descriptive manner. No need to care about the semantics of a graphical process notation nor to understand any UI framework technology. But while the world will change the modelled process will become more complex and should be given into the hands of a pro for further enhancements.
